Project Outline
Title: Optimizing Office Layouts Using Generative Design and Machine Learning

Purpose: 
	• To design an efficient and data-driven tool that maximizes the number of desks in an office layout while ensuring comfort, accessibility, and compliance with design constraints.
	• To integrate generative design (Revit Dynamo) and machine learning (Python) into a practical solution for architects and designer to make informed decisions.

Learning Outcome: 
	• Gain foundational skills in generative design
	• Learn how to integrate data analysis and machine learning for design optimization
	• Develop a decision-making tool that visualizes and ranks layouts.
