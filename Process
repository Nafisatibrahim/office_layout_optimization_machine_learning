Step 1: Define the Problem
	• Specify the office space (room dimensions)
	• Identify key constraints:
		○ Desk size
		○ Minimum aisle widths
		○ Total available
Step 2: Generate Designs Using Revit Dynamo
	1. Input parameters:
		a. Room dimensions
		b. Desk size
		c. Minimum clearances
	2. Create a Dynamo script to:
		a. Arrange desks in rows/ columns
		b. Iterate through various layout options.
	3. Export results:
		a. Desk count
		b. Aisle width
		c. Design metadata (layout coordinates, etc.) as a CSV file
Step 3: Analyze Designs Using Python
	1. Import CSV data into Python
	2. Define evaluation criteria:
		a. Maximize desk count
		b. Ensure adequate aisle spacing
	3. Build a scoring system:
		a. Weighted formula (prioritize desk count over other metrics)
	4. If possible: Use machine learning to train a model that predicts scores based on user feedback.
Step 4: Visualize and Rank Designs
	1. Use Power or Python (Matplotlib/ Seaborn) to:
		a. Visualize layout scores
		b. Rank layouts by optimality
	2. Create an interactive dashboard for architects and designers to select the best layout. (interactive dashboard with Python that will include a 3D model viewer)


Project Deliverables
	• Generative Design Script: A Dynamo script that outputs multiple office layouts.
	• Data Analysis Pipeline: Python scripts for processing design data and applying scoring/ranking models.
	• Visualization Dashboard: A tool to visualize and compare office layouts.
Documentation: Clear explanations of the workflow, scripts, and outputs.
